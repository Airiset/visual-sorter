# A Visual Sorter
An online visualization tool for sorting algorithms.

Ahh, sorting... The most **over-studied** concept in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. But why is this solved problem so important? 
First of all, it is a good introduction to algorithm analysis and problem-solving. Secondly, the variety of sorting strategies is ***HUGE***. 
There are algorithms useful for each type of situation. Some are more efficient memory-wise, while other's are more efficient based on their runtime.

And thus comes the purpose of this tool. To help students (and curious learners) visualize how these algorithms work.

Happy Sorting!
